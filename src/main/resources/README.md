Responses to all questions should be shared from your own GitHub repositories.

# Q1
## Problem Description
Create a program in Java to parse the file q1.test_data and write as key/value pairs in Excel and CSV file.
## Note
- SZ  [ represents the start of a transaction item (ex: Line1)  or you can take smh [record as the start of a transaction
]SZ à represents the end of a transaction (ex: Line29)
With this you should be able to identify how many transactions in this sample input file
You will have to create separate csv/excel file for each transaction (Note: All the transactions might not have the same keys)

- You can ignore any line which contains [record as this line doesn’t hold key or value
With this while you parse the sample file you should get the below keys and values (listed only few for your understanding)
smh_seg_id 000000
smh_seg_version 00
smh_msg_version 08.08.88
smh_tran_type ABC
